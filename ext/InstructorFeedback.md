### Project Problem Statement and Plan

EXCELLENT idea. I love the concept and think it will meet all the requirements 
of the project while providing you with a good challenge and an interesting 
product to show to prospective employers.  It looks like you are also on the 
right track with some design: itâ€™s good to see you thinking about how this will 
be structured. 

* Could you also lay out a detailed schedule? Break down the development into 
smaller tasks and then put those tasks into a schedule (at minimum, what will 
you accomplish each week)? For example: 

* Week 4
    * Complete UI design
    * Complete weekly blog entry
    * Complete application flow diagram 
    * Install Oracle
    * Set up login with Oracle as the tomcat realm

* Week 5
    * Build all JSPs
    * Complete database design
    * Design java classes
    * Complete weekly blog entry

* You have a great start - looking forward to seeing how things come together 
this weekend!
