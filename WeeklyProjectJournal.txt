Week 3: Project Conceptualization/ Frameworking

  So this is a project that I;ve been looking to start for some time, and this
course gave me the necessary kick in the pants if you will to throw some
serious effort behind it. After hearing the TED talk regarding words getting
into the dictionary and becoming 'real', I realized that there needed to be a
dedicated application to facilitate this idea in order to convince the world
at large that language is exactly what we make it, so lets MAKE it.

  This week was spent planning out the project, including writing out a solid
concept of what I want the application to do, along with a few ideas on how I
wanted to achieve it. This quickly led to a more outlined, conceptual
approach to the project, such as setting up a framework for the pages the
site will require along with the major 'classes' or functionality modules
which each will implement. The project should include two databases, one for
users and one for entry objects, and I laid out the elements that I
perceive each of these objects/ databases using. In short, I wanted to have
a lego-manual for the project: it shows all the pieces that are needed,
and how they will go together, leaving only the actual piecing together of
the individual elements. And lots of code :)

Week 4: Class and JSP Creation/ Framework Re-work

  Of course upon actually trying to put these ideas into a physical digital
entity, other issues/needs for the project became apparent. Through out the
week I added classes to the project to get something to work from, hoping to
go from there once a had a basic infrastructure. I drew lots of comparisons
to projects from past java classes and in fact a good bit of code from them
as well. As different facets of the project became apparent, and specific
functionality of other aspects came to light, my original framework has
become a running blueprint for the pages, classes and objects to be
implemented into the project.

  I was able to test out some basic aspects of the program by hardcoding a few
'User' and 'Entry' objects and putting them into arrays, though these objects
will be eventually be read from two database or stored in an xml file.
Still, being able to see the output of each type, even in terminal, is
refreshing amidst the frantics of this course so far. I'd like to be able to
dedicate all of my time to this project, but there are many other things to
learn at the same time! The plan for the next few days is to set up the
user interface, that is the webpages that the user will access the
application through. I have most of the JSPs created in their basic form,
but next I'd to add the page and form elements that will serve to take in
user input, and hopefully get a form to take information in and spit it
back out to the page, without worrying about the database that will
eventually be in between. I'm anxious and excited!
